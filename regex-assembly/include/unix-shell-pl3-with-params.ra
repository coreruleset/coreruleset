##! This list contains terms that are only searched for at PL 3.
##! Note that the equivalent could be achieved by using
##! `include` processors with both <= 3 and > 3 but that would
##! make the rule almost identical to its PL 1 counterparts,
##! artificially doubling the critiality of hits and adding
##! unnecessary overhead.

##! Note that this list is arbitrary. We do not have criteria
##! for inclusion in this list apart from false positive
##! reports.

##! This list must be in sync with:
##! - unix-shell-upto3.ra
##! - unix-shell-4andup-with-params
##! - unix-shell-pl3-for-cmndline

##! These patterns are approximations of the patterns used by the cmdline
##! processor for `@` and `~`.
