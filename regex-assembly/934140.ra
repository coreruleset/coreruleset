##! There is no need to match multiple '@', as perl won't execute:
##! ❯ perl -e 'print(@{[CORE::time()]});'
##! 1756644738%
##! ❯ perl -e 'print(@@{[CORE::time()]});' (does nothing)

##! We also added spacing as it will be executed until the terminating `;` by perl.

##!^ ^[^@]*(?:@[^{][^@]*)*

@\{\s*\[[^\]]*\]\s*\}
