##! XSS Filter - Category 2: Event Handler Vector.
##! Detects XSS via HTML event handlers (e.g., onload=, onerror=).
##! Matches "on" followed by 3-50 alphabetic characters and an equals sign.
##! The equals sign must be followed by a non-equals character to avoid
##! false positives with base64-encoded strings (which often end in = or ==).
