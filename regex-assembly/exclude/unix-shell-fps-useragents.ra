##! Please refer to the documentation at
##! https://coreruleset.org/docs/development/regex_assembly/.

##! This list excludes command words that are prone to cause false
##! positives from the following include files:
##!
##! - unix-shell-upto3.ra
##! - unix-shell-4andup.ra
##! - unix-shell-pl3.ra

##! This list is managed manually and contains known user-agents causing false positives
##! in rules checking for RCE in User-Agent and Referer request header.

##! To reduce complexity, this file simply lists all possible
##! variants of a word, so when a word would be changed from, e.g.,
##! `curl@` to `curl~`, this list would not have to be updated.
##! See also unix-shell-fps-pl1.ra.
