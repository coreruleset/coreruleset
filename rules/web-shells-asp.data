# This list contains patterns of various web shells, backdoors and similar
# software written in ASP language. There is no way how to automatically update
# this list, so it must be done by hand. Here is a recommended way how to add
# new malicious software:
# 1.) As patterns are matched against RESPONSE_BODY, you need to run a malicious
#     software (ideally in an isolated environment) and catch the output.
# 2.) In the output, search for static pattern unique enough to match only
#     the software in question and to not do any FPs. The best pick is usually
#     a part of HTML code with software name.
# 3.) Include software name and URL (if available) in the comment above
#     the pattern.
