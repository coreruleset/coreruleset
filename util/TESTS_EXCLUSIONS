# This file defines rules that are expected to fail the "rules without tests" lint check.
# These are mainly administrative rules.
#
# Lines starting with `#` are considered comments.
# Every non-empty, non-commented line is expected to be a rule number (e.g. 123456) or
# rule number prefix (e.g., 1234, or 12). Prefixes will match all rules IDs with the same prefix.
# The linter will skip the "rules without tests" lint check for any matching rule ID.
#
# See https://github.com/coreruleset/crs-linter for reference.
