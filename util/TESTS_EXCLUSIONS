# This file defines rules that are expected to fail the "rules without tests" lint check.
# These are mainly administrative rules.
#
# Lines starting with `#` are considered comments.
# Every non-empty, non-commented line is expected to be a rule number or rule number prefix
# for which the "rules without tests" lint check will be skipped for matching rules.
#
# You can add explicit rule id's or rules' groups, like
# 921170
# or
# 900
# 9551
#
# Linter tries to match the pattern to the rule ID, with the
# length of given pattern. 900 means all rules were id like with 900XXX,
# 9551 means rules where id like 9551XX
#
# See https://github.com/coreruleset/crs-linter for reference.
