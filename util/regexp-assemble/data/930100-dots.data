##! This is a data file used to generate a regular expression for a CRS rule. 
##! The generation of the regular expression happens with the help of 
##! util/regexp-assemble/regexp-assemble.py.
##! The ID of the rule in question is part of the file name of this data file. 
##! Read more about the format of this data file and the use of the assembly 
##! script in util/regexp-assemble/README.md.
##!
##! Lines starting with `##!` are comments and will be skipped,
##! empty lines will be ignored completely.
##! In addition, the quote character `'` at the beginning of a line will
##! cause the line to be interpreted as literal by the cmdline preprocessor only.
##! 
##! Five special comments are at your disposal to influence the assembled expression:
##! - `##!+`: the flag comment
##! - `##!^`: the prefix comment
##! - `##!$`: the suffix comment
##! - `##!>`: the preprocessor comment
##! - `##!<`: the block preprocessor end comment
##!
##! Currently supported preprocessors:
##! - cmdline [windows|unix] (file scope)
##! Please refer to util/regexp-assemble/README.md for a full explanation.

##! Attack description: https://doc.lagout.org/security/McGraw.Hill.HackNotes.Web.Security.Portable.Reference.eBook-DDU.pdf
##! Excerpt:
##! In short, IIS turns %c0%af into
##! the ASCII / character, but parses it at a point where security checks for
##! ‘../’ traversals have already occurred!
##! What has really happened? The attack uses an overlong Unicode
##! representation for a forward or backward slash (/ or \).
##! Unicode permits multibyte encoding of the same character.
##! The fundamental representation can be referred to as a one (character) to one (byte field)
##! representation. The overlong representation is a one (character) to many
##! (bytes) version.
##! Two more valid strings that represent the backward slash are %c1%1c
##! and %c1%9c. The difference between these two hex values is 128. More
##! valid slash representations boil down to a matter of math. For example,
##! %c0%9v works even though %9v isn’t a hexadecimal value. Try adding
##! the value for “9” (57) to “v” (118); if the result is greater than 127, then
##! subtract 128—hint, the final result should be 47.

##! Append {2,3} to the result, as we're looking for two or three dots (e.g. /../, /.../)
##!$ {2,3}

##! These use the same techniques as for slashes to evade the detection of '.'
