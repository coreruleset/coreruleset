##! This is a data file used to generate a regular expression for a CRS rule. 
##! The generation of the regular expression happens with the help of 
##! util/regexp-assemble/regexp-assemble.py.
##! The ID of the rule in question is part of the file name of this data file. 
##! Read more about the format of this data file and the use of the assembly 
##! script in util/regexp-assemble/README.md.
##!
##! Lines starting with `##!` are comments and will be skipped,
##! empty lines will be ignored completely.
##! In addition, the quote character `'` at the beginning of a line will
##! cause the line to be interpreted as literal by the cmdline preprocessor only.
##! 
##! Five special comments are at your disposal to influence the assembled expression:
##! - `##!+`: the flag comment
##! - `##!^`: the prefix comment
##! - `##!$`: the suffix comment
##! - `##!>`: the preprocessor comment
##! - `##!<`: the block preprocessor end comment
##!
##! Currently supported preprocessors:
##! - cmdline [windows|unix] (file scope)
##! Please refer to util/regexp-assemble/README.md for a full explanation

##! Word list for rule 932101 (RCE Unix command injection part 3/4)

##! To prevent some FP for a command, you can require command parameters
##! after a command. Only do this if the command regularly causes FP and if
##! allowing the bare command (without parameters) is not too dangerous.
##! (Note: due to \b following the regexp, a word boundary is also required
##! further on, so some letter/number is needed for a match). Example:
##!
##!   diff+

##! Special regexp case for the '.' (source) command to prevent FP:

##! Magic prefix (origin unknown)
##!^ (?:;|\{|\||\|\||&|&&|\n|\r|\$\(|\$\(\(|`|\${|<\(|>\(|\(\s*\))\s*(?:{|\s*\(\s*|\w+=(?:[^\s]*|\$.*|\$.*|<.*|>.*|\'.*\'|\".*\")\s+|!\s*|\$)*\s*(?:'|\")*(?:[\?\*\[\]\(\)\-\|+\w'\"\./\x5c]+/)?[\x5c'\"]*
