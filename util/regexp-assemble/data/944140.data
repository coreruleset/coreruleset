##! This is a data file used to generate a regular expression for a CRS rule. 
##! The generation of the regular expression happens with the help of 
##! util/regexp-assemble/regexp-assemble.py.
##! The ID of the rule in question is part of the file name of this data file. 
##! Read more about the format of this data file and the use of the assembly 
##! script in util/regexp-assemble/README.md.
##!
##! Lines starting with `##!` are comments and will be skipped,
##! empty lines will be ignored completely.
##! In addition, the quote character `'` at the beginning of a line will
##! cause the line to be interpreted as literal by the cmdline preprocessor only.
##! 
##! Five special comments are at your disposal to influence the assembled expression:
##! - `##!+`: the flag comment
##! - `##!^`: the prefix comment
##! - `##!$`: the suffix comment
##! - `##!>`: the preprocessor comment
##! - `##!<`: the block preprocessor end comment
##!
##! Currently supported preoprocessors:
##! - cmdline [windows|unix] (file scope)
##! Please refer to util/regexp-assemble/README.md for a full explanation

##! The following is an expansion of
##! (?:\${[^}]{0,15}\${|\${(?:jndi|ctx))
##! where every character also matches the equivalent named HTML entity.
##! It is a workaround for the shortcomings of `htmlEntityDecode`, which
##! handles numerical HTML entities well but only handles 5 named
##! entities. The official list of named entities can be found here:
##! https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html.
##!
##! Note:
##!     - We don't match `&rbrace;` or `&rcub;` because it would enable more
##!         evasions while also increasing the number of potential false positives.
##!         The risk of false negatives in this case is acceptable.
##!     - Omitting the terminating semi-colon can be used as an evasion with lenient
##!         parsers. We catch those by making the semi-colon optional.
