##! This is a data file used to generate a regular expression for a CRS rule. 
##! The generation of the regular expression happens with the help of 
##! util/regexp-assemble/regexp-assemble.py.
##! The ID of the rule in question is part of the file name of this data file. 
##! Read more about the format of this data file and the use of the assembly 
##! script in util/regexp-assemble/README.md.
##!
##! Lines starting with `##!` are comments and will be skipped,
##! empty lines will be ignored completely.
##! 
##! Five special comments are at your disposal to influence the assembled expression:
##! - `##!+`: the flag comment
##! - `##!^`: the prefix comment
##! - `##!$`: the suffix comment
##! - `##!>`: the preprocessor comment
##! - `##!<`: the block preprocessor end comment
##! Please refer to util/regexp-assemble/README.md for a full explanation.
