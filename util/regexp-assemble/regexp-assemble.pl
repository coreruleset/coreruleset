  # The following lines parse an expression like `(a++|b)++|b` into an array of `["(a++|b)+", "+", "|", "b"]`

  # We explicitly don't use `_fastlex` or `split` here (as is done in `_add`). `lexstr` uses `_lex`, which is
  # more expensive but produces more reliable output. On the downside, some characters will be escaped (or
  # will retain their escape) even though they don't need to be.

  # Example escape introduced by `_lex`: `/` produces `\/`
