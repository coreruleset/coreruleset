    Test whether the outbound blocking mechanism works by testing whether rule 959100 is triggered.
    For these tests, existing test are repurposed with different assertions. Instead of asserting that the original
    rules are triggered that the tests are written for, we assert that triggering these rules causes the blocking
    rule to be triggered.
rule_id: 959100
tests:
  - test_id: 1
    desc: Test is basically identical to 953120-1 (PHP leakage positive test in phase 4) but here we assert that the outbound blocking mechanism is triggered
    stages:
      - input:
          dest_addr: "127.0.0.1"
          port: 80
          headers:

  - test_id: 2
    desc: Test is basically identical to 953120-1 (PHP leakage negative test in phase 4) but here we assert that the outbound blocking mechanism is not triggered
